# Prerequisite

In order to run the parser you will need to have the Microsoft .NET Core 3.1 Runtime installed on your computer. You can download it from Microsoft here:

# Download

Once you've updated your system with the .NET Core runtime, you can download the parser from here:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/raidloot/logsync.exe

This is just a portable executuable file. There is no installer for the app yet. I recommend you save it to a folder somewhere on your desktop.

The first time you run the parser will you get a "Windows protected your PC" alert. This is called SmartScreen and protects your PC from running programs from unrecognized publishers - which is what I am. If you want to run the parser you will need to click the "More Info" link on the popup and then "Run anyway".

You may also get a Windows Firewall popup asking if the app can access the internet. You will need to allow this since part of the parser's job is to send data over the internet.
